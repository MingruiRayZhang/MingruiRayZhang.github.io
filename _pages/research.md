My research utilizes both econometric and analytical methodologies to examine the impact of technological innovations across various market contexts. I examine the impact of technology advancements, the dynamics of strategic collaborations, and the influence of consumers perceptions. Looking ahead, I aim to expand my research agenda to incorporate topics in Cyberscurity and Atificial Intelligence.

### Working papers

- ***Harnessing Tensor Completion with Geo-location: Impacts of Smart Vending Machines in Urban Landscapes*** (with Wanning Chen, Yong Tan, Xusen Cheng)
  - This study uses low-rank tensor completion with truncated nuclear norm methods on extensive data to understand the impact of smart vending machines on urban consumers.

- ***Investor Learning in Crowdfunded Supply Chain Finance Markets*** (with Zhijin Zhou, Shengsheng Xiao, Yi-Chun (Chad) Ho, Yong Tan) [Under major revision at *Production and Operations Management*]
  - Investors in crowdfunded SCF adjust their views on guarantor reliability from loan repayments and act accordingly. This perception impacts investor reactions to factors like interest rate, affecting market efficiency and fundraising success.

- ***Frenemies in the Retail Market: A Partnership Between a Physical Retailer and an E-tailer for Consumer Returns*** (with Lin Hao, Shi Chen, Yong Tan) [Preparing for journal submission]
  -  Retailer-e-tailer partnerships can reduce competition when return handling and offline shopping costs hit specific thresholds. This reduced competition might lower consumer surplus, disadvantaging consumers.
  
- ***When to Disclose Product Quality under Online Reviews?*** (with He Huang, Yufeng Yang, Hongyan Xu, Tingting Nian) [Preparing for journal submission]
  - With clearer online reviews, firms lean towards disclosing product quality due to changing consumer behavior. The firm's selling scheme choice hinges on factors like commission rates, with a bias towards quality disclosure.

- ***Information Leakage Prior to SEC Form Filings --- Evidence from TAQ Millisecond Data*** (with Steven Wei Ho, Weiting Hong)
  - There's evident information leakage around SEC filings, with stocks that surge before filing releases also rising post-release, and vice versa for declines. These price shifts aren't due to momentum or past SEC technical issues, highlighting a new, previously unexplored 30-minute trend.

### Ongoing Projects

- ***The Gamer-Developer Feedback Loop: Navigating Review Dynamics in Digital Marketplaces*** (with Yingda Lu)
  - Positive reviews shape perceptions more than gameplay duration; game updates and developer responses influence review dynamics.
- ***Contract Design for Cloud Services with Privacy and Security Concerns*** (with Hongyan Xu, Ying Wang, Shi Chen)
  - strategically designed contracts in cloud services could effectively balance pricing, liability, and data licensing, and address the growing challenges of data privacy and security in a rapidly expanding market.
